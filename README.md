# ARFF_for_HealthMap

In this project, GATE as a Natural Language Processing tool is connected to Weka as a Machine Learning tool.

A GATE document which is annotated by the linguistic elements is given to the system and an arff file which contains a feature vector for each instance (expression/sentence) is created. The arff file is used by Weka to classify the instances.
